# MiniTweaks

MiniTweaks is a collection of different little tweaks and quality-of-life improvements for your desktop workflow. The curren focus is the Windows desktop, but that's not to say there won't be tweaks for macOS and Linux in the future. Feel freee to contribute any way you prefer. If you have questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me directly or submit a new thread under "issues".
