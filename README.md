# MiniTweaks

MiniTweaks is a collection of different little tweaks and quality-of-life improvements for your desktop workflow. The current focus is the Windows desktop, but that's not to say there won't be tweaks for macOS and Linux in the future. Feel free to contribute any way you prefer. If you have questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me directly or submit a new thread under "issues".

# Available Tweaks #
The following are tweaks currently available as part of the MiniTweaks collection.

## ThemeCycle ##
ThemeCycle is the first (and currently the only) publicly made available tweaks. it is an automation tweak for Windows that allows your PC to automatically switch between dark and light modes based on the time of day. This is a popular feature available on other platforms such as iOS, and even Microsoft's Xbox operating system. Now, with this tweak, we can have it on Windows too while we wait for Microsoft to eventually get around to implementing it...if ever.
